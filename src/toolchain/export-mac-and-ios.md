# Export to macOS and iOS

Mac libraries that are intended to be shared with other people require Code Signing and Notarization. For this you will need:

- A Mac Computer
- An Apple ID enrolled in Apple Developer Program (99 USD per year)

Without Code Signing and Notarization, the other person can still use the built library, but either needs to:

- rebuild the whole thing locally
- re-sign it
- accept that it may contain malicious code.

Prerequisites:

- Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on your Mac computer.


## Building macOS universal lib


Add both x64 and arm64 targets. This is needed in order to create a universal build.

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Build the library for both target architectures:

```sh
cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-darwin --release
cargo build --target=aarch64-apple-darwin --release
```

Run the [lipo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary) tool
to merge the two in one universal library.

```sh
lipo -create -output target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.dylib \
    target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/lib{YourCrate}.dylib \
    target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/lib{YourCrate}.dylib
```

The result of this will be the file `target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.dylib` that will now have support for both x64 and arm64 platforms.

The user would need to replace `{YourCrate}` with the crate name.
The name of your library will be the one you provided in `Cargo.toml` file, prefixed with `lib` and followed by `.dylib`:

```ini
[package]
name = "{YourCrate}"
```

Next, you will need to create the `.framework` folder.

```sh
mkdir target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.framework
cp target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.dylib \
    target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.framework/lib{YourCrate}.macos.dylib
```

Next, create the `Info.plist` file inside the `Resources` folder:

```sh
mkdir target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.framework/Resources
```

File contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
    <string>lib{YourCrate}.macos.dylib</string>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
    <string>org.mywebsite.myapp</string>
    <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
    <string>6.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key>
    <string>My App Name</string>
    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
    <string>FMWK</string>
    <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
    <string>1.0.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleSupportedPlatforms</key>
    <array>
        <string>MacOSX</string>
    </array>
    <key>NSHumanReadableCopyright</key>
    <string>Copyright (c)...</string>
    <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
    <string>1.0.0</string>
    <key>LSMinimumSystemVersion</key>
    <string>10.12</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```admonish note title="XML format"
The `CFBundleExecutable` name **must** match the dylib file name. Some of the contents in the XML file  **must** not contain some characters.
Generally avoid using anything other than letters and numbers.
Related [StackOverflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3757817/plist-contains-the-character).
```

Edit the project's `.gdextension` file to include support for macOS.
This file will probably be at `godot/{YourCrate}.gdextension`.
The format will be similar to the following:

```ini
[libraries]
...
macos.release = "res://../rust/target/release/lib{YourCrate}.macos.framework"
```


## Building an iOS library


Add as target arm64 iOS.

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
```

Build the library:

```sh
cargo build --target=aarch64-apple-ios --release
```

The result of this will be the file `target/aarch64-apple-ios/release/lib{YourCrate}.dylib`.

Next, you will need to create the `.framework` folder.

```sh
mkdir target/release/lib{YourCrate}.ios.framework
cp target/release/lib{YourCrate}.ios.dylib \
    target/release/lib{YourCrate}.ios.framework/lib{YourCrate}.ios.dylib
```

Next, create the `Info.plist` file inside the `.framework` folder, with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
    <string>6.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key>
    <string>en</string>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
    <string>lib{YourCrate}.ios.dylib</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key>
    <string>My App Name</string>
    <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
    <string>My App Name</string>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
    <string>org.my-website.my-app</string>
    <key>NSHumanReadableCopyright</key>
    <string>Copyright (c) ...</string>
    <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
    <string>0.12.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
    <string>0.12.0</string>
    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
    <string>FMWK</string>
    <key>CSResourcesFileMapped</key>
    <true/>
    <key>DTPlatformName</key>
    <string>iphoneos</string>
    <key>MinimumOSVersion</key>
    <string>12.0</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

See XML format requirements above.

Edit the project's `.gdextension` file to include support for iOS.
This file will probably be at `godot/{YourCrate}.gdextension`.
The format will be similar to the following:

```ini
[libraries]
...
ios.release = "res://../rust/target/release/lib{YourCrate}.ios.framework"
```


## Code Signing and Notarizing (macOS only)


```admonish note title="Optional Step"
This step is only needed if you want to share the library.
If you are building the whole game, you will sign everything and don't need to sign the library. You can skip to [Godot Build](#godot-build) step.
```

In order to code-sign and notarize your app, you will first need to gather some information from your enrolled Apple Developer account.
We will create corresponding environment variables and use a script to sign, so it's easier to run. Here are the environment variables needed:

- `APPLE_CERT_BASE64`
- `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_DEV_ID`
- `APPLE_DEV_TEAM_ID`
- `APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_DEV_APP_ID`

Firstly, make sure to enroll your Apple ID to the Developer Program:

- Create an Apple ID if you don't have one already.
- Use your Apple ID to register in the Apple Developer Program by going to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
- Accept all agreements from the Apple Developer Page.


### `APPLE_DEV_ID` - Apple ID


Your email used for your Apple ID.

```sh
APPLE_DEV_ID = email@provider.com
```


### `APPLE_DEV_TEAM_ID` - Apple Team ID


Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com). Go to account.

Go to membership details. Copy Team ID.

```sh
APPLE_DEV_TEAM_ID = 1ABCD23EFG
```


### `APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD` - Apple App-Specific Password


Create Apple App-Specific Password. Copy the password.

```sh
APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD = abcd-abcd-abcd-abcd
```


### `APPLE_CERT_BASE64`, `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` and `APPLE_DEV_APP_ID`


Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com). Go to account.

Go to certificates.

Click on + at Certificates tab. Create Developer ID Application. Click Continue.

Leave profile type as is. Create a certificate signing request from a Mac. You can use your own name and email address. Save the file to disk.
You will get a file called `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest`. Upload it to the Developer ID Application request. Click Continue.

Download the certificate. You will get a file `developerID_application.cer`.

On a Mac, right click and select open. Add it to the login keychain.
In the Keychain Access app that opened, log into Keychain tab, go to Keys, sort by date modified,
and expand your key (the key should have the name you entered at _Common Name_).
Right click the expanded certificate, get info, and copy the text at _Details -> Subject Name -> Common Name_. For example:

```sh
APPLE_DEV_APP_ID = Developer ID Application: Common Name (1ABCD23EFG)
```

Then, select the certificate, right click and click export. At file format select `p12`. When exporting, set a password for the certificate.
This will be the value of `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`. You will get a `Certificates.p12` file.

For example:

```sh
APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD = <password_set_when_exporting_p12>
```

Then you need to make a base64 file out of it, by running:

```sh
base64 -i Certificates.p12 -o Certificates.base64
```

Copy the contents of the generated file, e.g.:

```sh
APPLE_CERT_BASE64 = ...(A long text file)
```

After these secrets are obtained, all that remains is to set them as environment variables.
Afterwards you can use the following script
for signing [ci-sign-macos.ps1](https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt/blob/master/scripts/ci_sign_macos.ps1).
In order to run this script you will need to install [powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) on your Mac.

```powershell
ci-sign-macos.ps1 target/release/{YourCrate}.framework
```

```admonish note title="External script disclaimer"
The user is responsible for the security and up-to-dateness of the script.
```


## Godot Build


After building the libraries, you can now distribute them as they are, or build the whole game using Godot.
For that, follow Godot's _How to export_ guide:

- [Exporting for macOS](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_macos.html)
- [Exporting for iOS](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_ios.html)
